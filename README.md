## how to contribute

(leaving out the details, google is your friend)

1. fork the repo
2. clone your forked repo
3. make a folder with your name and create a Javascript file for each challenge you complete
4. push the changes to your repo
5. click pull request
6. wait for Cliff or Zach to approve the request.

## Challenges

#### Zach and Cliff are doing one challenge per day but you can blitz them if you want.

1. Arrays.

   - Build an array in different ways.
   - Research different array methods
   - recreate an array method in a function.

2. Singely Linked Lists

   - Research different linked list methods
   - Create a singley linked list with a good amount of methods, here are a few examples:
     - add
     - removeHead
     - removeTail
     - contains
     - findIf(callback)
     - removeDuplicates
     - print
     - printLength

3. Hash Map/ Hash Table

   - Research different hash map methods
   - Create a hash map with a good amount of methods, here are a few examples:
     - Hashing function
     - set
     - get
     - remove
     - \*\*resize (if the hash map is getting too big use this by comparing the "load factor" to a threshold value and resize if it is greater than the threshold value. the hash map should be resized by doubling the size of the hash map and rehashing all the values into the new hash map.)

4. Sorted Binary Search Trees

   - Research different binary search tree methods
   - Create a binary search tree with a good amount of methods, here are a few examples:
     - insert(value)
     - remove(value)
     - print

5. Queues

   - Research different queue methods
   - Create a queue with a good amount of methods, here are a few examples:
     - enqueue(value)
     - dequeue
     - print

6. Stacks
   - Research different stack methods
   - Create a stack with a good amount of methods, here are a few examples:
     - push(value)
     - pop
     - print

#### let's do a few fun coding challenges

7.  Reverse an array in place (no new array and no array methods)

8.  Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean
    representing whether the string is a palindrome.

    - A palindrome is a word that is the same whether written backward or forward.
    - For example, `"racecar"` is a palindrome.
    - Try to solve this using left and right pointers.
